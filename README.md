Rock paper scissors game!

This was a fun little project that I made using HTML+CSS+JS. 

The game is very simple, you have 3 buttons to chose your "weapon" of choice which can be either: Rock, Paper or Scissors! 

Once you pick your choice, the computer will randomly select an option as well and it will compare the choices between the two players. 

The logic is quite simple and follows the standard rules of the game:

Rock beats Scissors.

Paper beats Rock.

Scissors beats Paper.

thanks for playing :)
